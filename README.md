## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to consider features taken from the Iowa Economic Indicators Data Set covering a range of indexes and values used to measure the state of Iowa's economic performance at a given time, using the target variable of Iowa's GDP from the years 1999 to 2024. 

The economic landscape of Iowa, like that of many states, is influenced by a variety of factors, ranging from industrial production to agricultural performance. Understanding the relationship between different economic indicators, such as manufacturing activity, agricultural profits, and the broader economic performance measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is crucial for policymakers, businesses, and citizens to make informed decisions.

This project seeks to explore the economic trends in Iowa by analyzing monthly economic indicators from 1999 to 2024 and comparing them to the state's annual GDP data. The goal of the descriptive analysis is to identify potential relationships between key economic indicators and GDP, which could provide valuable insights into the state's economic health and help predict future trends. This project will integrate monthly economic indicators, such as manufacturing hours, building permits, and agricultural profits, with yearly GDP data scraped from publicly available sources. By imputing GDP values for each month of a given year, we can examine how various economic factors fluctuate over time and correlate with the state's overall economic output. 

Understanding these patterns could have significant implications for state-level policy decisions, business investments, and economic forecasting. For instance, if certain indicators consistently show strong correlations with GDP growth, they could serve as leading signals for future economic performance. I was particularly inspired to pick these sources of data for the project as Iâ€™m interested in exactly how impactful the agricultural economic indicators are on the GDP and other metrics, as Iowa is known to be an agricultural state.
